## RSVP Nano Tweaks

This fork adds a small set of practical fixes for the Waveshare ESP32-S3 Touch LCD 3.49 Rev2:

- preserves Unicode letters, including Polish diacritics, in uploaded book filenames;
- accepts EPUB font obfuscation while continuing to reject encrypted book content;
- adds a persistent 180-degree screen rotation setting with matching touch coordinates.

See [the RSVP Nano Tweaks release notes](docs/releases/v0.0.9-tweaks.1.md) for installation and
compatibility details. The project remains based on the upstream RSVP Nano firmware.

## What is RSVP Nano?

RSVP Nano is a small standalone reader that presents text one word at a time using Rapid Serial
Visual Presentation. It also supports page reading when you want surrounding context. Books,
articles, settings, fonts, themes, languages, and reading progress live on a microSD card.

The project includes:

- Multi-board ESP32 firmware with RSVP and page reading.
- A responsive Compose Multiplatform web companion for setup, flashing, conversion, and management.
- Android and iOS companions built on shared Kotlin Multiplatform logic.
- A shared Kotlin conversion engine for EPUB, text, Markdown, HTML, XHTML, and RSVP files.
- Installable reader fonts, interface language packs, and color themes.

RSVP Nano is under active development. The current release line is `0.x`, so back up important SD
card content before testing new firmware.

## Highlights

- **Two reading modes:** focused RSVP playback and paragraph-aware page reading.
- **Multilingual text:** bidirectional text, Arabic and Hebrew shaping, CJK fonts, and vertical CJK
  books.
- **Personal appearance:** installable RFont4 reader fonts, locale packs, downloadable themes,
  focus highlighting, tracking, guide geometry, and handed layouts.
- **Companion management:** library uploads, progress editing, settings, Wi-Fi, RSS feeds, focus
  timers, fonts, themes, locales, and firmware updates.
- **Flexible connections:** local-network sync, the Nano's direct Wi-Fi network, USB companion
  control, and USB mass-storage transfer on supported boards.
- **Offline-friendly setup:** an installable PWA shell, browser firmware installation, Improv Wi-Fi
  provisioning, and local file conversion without a server-side converter.
- **Device utilities:** OTA updates, SD diagnostics, configurable focus routines, and Life, Maze,
  Voronoi, and Reaction screensavers.

## Get started

You need a supported RSVP Nano board, a USB-C data cable, and a FAT32 microSD card. An 8 GB to
32 GB card is the safest choice.

1. Open the [web companion](https://ionutdecebal.github.io/rsvpnano/) in a desktop browser.
2. Choose your board and install the latest firmware.
3. Follow setup to provision Wi-Fi and verify the reader.
4. Add an EPUB, RSVP, text, Markdown, HTML, or XHTML file from the Library screen.
5. Open the book on the Nano and start reading.

Chrome or Edge is required for browser flashing and USB companion access because those features use
Web Serial. The site still supports local-network management in browsers that can reach the reader.

The web installer uses the firmware bundled with the latest published release. You can also choose a
compatible full-image `.bin` file manually. Firmware already installed on a Nano can update through
the device's OTA flow.

Most LCD 3.49 readers use rev1. Try rev2 when the display works but backlight control does not.

## Companion apps

| Companion | UI | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Web](https://ionutdecebal.github.io/rsvpnano/) | Compose Multiplatform on Kotlin/Wasm | Hosted setup, flashing, conversion, USB, and LAN management |
| [Android](companion/apps/android/README.md) | Jetpack Compose | Build from source |
| [iOS](companion/apps/ios/RSVPNanoCompanion/README.md) | SwiftUI | Build from source |

The companions share device models, API contracts, conversion, persistence formats, and workflows.
Their layouts remain platform-specific.

To connect over Wi-Fi, open Companion Sync on the Nano. The apps prefer a reader discovered on the
same local network and can fall back to the Nano's direct `RSVP-Nano-xxxxxx` network or a manual
address. The web companion can also connect directly over USB on supported desktop browsers.

## Library and SD card

The firmware creates its standard folders when writable storage is available. The main layout is:

```text
/library/books
/library/articles
/config
/fonts
/locales
/themes
```

Older cards using `/books` are migrated to `/library` without overwriting existing files. The same repair and validation pass is available from the Nano's Device screen and from the web or mobile companion while connected.

Books and articles may be uploaded by a companion or copied directly to the card. The reader creates
rebuildable `.ridx` and `.rdat` index files plus hidden `.rstate.toml` files for durable progress and
per-book typography.

Always eject USB mass storage before disconnecting it. Run the on-device SD card check if the
library is missing, read-only, or using an unexpected filesystem layout.

Configuration is stored as versionless TOML. See [Configuration](docs/configuration.md) for settings,
RSS, focus timers, themes, NVS mirroring, and recovery behavior.

## Build from source

Clone submodules first:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ionutdecebal/rsvpnano.git
cd rsvpnano
```

### Firmware

Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), then build one target:

```bash
pio run -e waveshare_esp32s3_touch_lcd_349_rev1
```

Upload to a connected board:

```bash
pio run -e waveshare_esp32s3_touch_lcd_349_rev1 -t upload
```

Run native firmware tests:

```bash
pio test -e native_test
```

### Web and mobile companions

Companion builds require JDK 17. Android also requires the Android SDK; iOS requires macOS and Xcode.

```bash
# Browser tests and staged Pages distribution
./gradlew checkWeb

# Shared tests and Android release build
./gradlew checkAndroid

# Shared iOS compilation and simulator tests
./gradlew checkIos
```

The staged website is written to `build/webSite`. Detailed native setup is in the
[Android](companion/apps/android/README.md) and
[iOS](companion/apps/ios/RSVPNanoCompanion/README.md) guides.

Issues and focused pull requests are welcome. Before opening a change:

1. Build the affected firmware or companion target.
2. Run the smallest relevant test suite.
3. Keep board-specific behavior inside its platform directory.
4. Reuse shared companion and conversion logic instead of creating another platform implementation.
5. Include hardware validation details for changes that affect display, touch, power, storage, or USB.
